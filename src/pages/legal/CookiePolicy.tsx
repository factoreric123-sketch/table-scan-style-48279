        <h2>5. How to Manage Cookies</h2>
        
        <h3>Browser Settings</h3>
        <p>
          Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Block all cookies</li>
          <li>Block third-party cookies only</li>
          <li>Delete cookies after each session</li>
          <li>View and delete existing cookies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here's how to manage cookies in popular browsers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> Settings → Privacy and security → Cookies and other site data</li>
          <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Settings → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data</li>
          <li><strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences → Privacy → Cookies and website data</li>
          <li><strong>Edge:</strong> Settings → Privacy, search, and services → Cookies and site permissions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          If you disable cookies, some features may not work properly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You may need to log in each time you visit</li>
          <li>Your preferences won't be remembered</li>
          <li>Some interactive features may not function</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Essential cookies cannot be disabled as they are necessary for the service to function.

      <section>
        <h2>6. Do Not Track</h2>
        <p>
          Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals websites not to track your activity. Currently, there is no industry standard for how to respond to DNT signals. We do not track users across third-party websites for advertising purposes.
